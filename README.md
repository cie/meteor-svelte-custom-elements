# Svelte Custom Elements for Meteor

Use Svelte-built custom elements in Meteor. Forked from the [`svelte:compiler`](https://github.com/meteor-svelte/meteor-svelte) package.

## Installation

This package assumes that you are using [`svelte:compiler`](https://github.com/meteor-svelte/meteor-svelte) anyways, and you would like to use both normal Svelte components and custom elements in parallel. So you probably have the `svelte` npm package installed. Then:

```
$ meteor add cie:meteor-svelte-custom-elements
```

## Options

Compiler options can be specified with a `"cie:svelte-custom-elements"` property in `package.json`. For example:

```
{
  ...
  "cie:svelte-custom-elements": {
    "extensions": ["svelte-ce"]
  }
}
```

**`extensions` (default: `["svelte-ce"]`)**

An array of file extensions to be recognized by the package.
Note that HTML files are not compiled with the Svelte compiler if they contain top-level `<head>` or `<body>` elements.
Instead, the contents of the elements are added to the respective sections in the HTML output generated by Meteor (similar to what the `static-html` package does).

**`css` (default: `true`)**

Svelte can [extract styles for server-side rendering](https://svelte.dev/docs#Server-side_component_API).
If you want to render CSS on the server, you might want to set the `css` option to `false` so that client-rendered components don't insert CSS into the DOM.
